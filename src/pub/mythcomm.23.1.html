            <div id="oac_cnt_chars" property="cnt:chars">Euripides&#8217; *The Bacchae* and Aristophanes&#8217; *Frogs* present two contradicting characterizations of the god Dionysus. On the
               surface, these two plays have much in common: both playwrights wrote around the same time, and for the same Athenian audience,
               and the plays themselves both premiered at the City Dionysia at the end of the fourth century B.C., probably within a few
               years of one another (OCD, Euripides, Aristophanes). *The Bacchae* and *Frogs* do not differ in their historical context or
               their audience, but in their genres as tragedy and comedy.
               *The Bacchae* is a tragedy. In it, Euripides portrays Dionysus as a powerful, vengeful god who has come to Thebes, his ancestral
               home, seeking vengeance on those who challenge his legitimacy as an Olympian. The play opens with a sort of prologue in which
               Dionysus himself addresses the audience, providing this background information on his presence in Thebes and illustrating
               his plan to initiate the women of the city into his cult of Maenads. Dionysus carries out his plan with ease. He even engages
               the sententious King Pentheus and, capitalizing on the king&#8217;s secret desire to view the Maenads, leads him to a gory death
               at the hands of his own converted mother, Agave. Euripides&#8217; Dionysus never stops scheming. He is proud, manipulative, highly
               intelligent, and totally unforgiving; he even punishes his own grandfather, Cadmus, one of the only Thebans who wouldn&#8217;t openly
               challenge him. This characterization of Dionysus conforms perfectly to the play&#8217;s tragic plot.
               The comic Dionysus of Aristophanes&#8217; *Frogs* could not be more different. Unlike the intelligent, capable god of *The Bacchae*,
               Aristophanes&#8217; Dionysus jokes and complains his way through this humorous journey to the underworld in order to retrieve his
               favorite poet, Euripides. In stark contrast to Euripides&#8217; dramatic opening prologue, *Frogs* begins with the god participating
               in a joke about bodily functions, and then proceeds to follow Dionysus and his long-suffering servant Xanthius on a journey
               that reveals this version of Dionysus to be not only feeble and lazy, but downright cowardly as well. He complains about everything
               from blisters and an aching backside to the noises made by frogs, actually a poetic song about Dionysus himself and his Olympian
               brethren. Dressed as Heracles, Dionysus attempts to take every advantage of this heroic disguise for himself, but forces Xanthius
               to assume the identity whenever an enemy of Heracles threatens a more dangerous outcome. Comically, this never seems to work
               out in Dionysus&#8217;s favor, proving that he is far less skilled in manipulation than his tragic counterpart. In both plays, Dionysus
               announces a plan in his first scene onstage, but Aristophanes&#8217; Dionysus fails to follow through, instead deciding to save
               Aeschylus from the underworld and leave Euripides behind, proving him indecisive as well.
               While the nature of *The Bacchae* requires Euripides to portray Dionysus as intelligent, decisive and cruel in order for the
               play to reach its tragic outcome, the comic Aristophanes must characterize him as the opposite: cowardly, dithering and dumb.
